# Bucket List
- Doxygen
- Consider separate container optimized for flag components for systems with no real data
- unwrapping some code (more implementation, less function calls)
- inheritance vs enum switching
- functional programming 
- interfaces 
- sparse bitstring signature vs packed array directly with types

# In Progress
- game coordinator, handling erasing entity with signature, component, system recognizing
- much testing
